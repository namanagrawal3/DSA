/*
This is a Concrete class (A class that provide implementation details of an interface/abstract class).
Now anyone can make an object of 'SportsCar' and can assign it to 'Car' reference.

In our real world example of Car, as you cannot have a real car by just having its body only
(all these buttons or pedals). You need to have the actual implementation of 'What' happens
when we press these buttons. 'SportsCar' class denotes that actual implementation.

Hence, we can conclude to denote a real world car in programming we created 2 classes.
One to denote all the user-interface like pedals, buttons, steering wheels etc ('Car' interface).
And another one to denote the actual car with all the implementations of these buttons (SportsCar' class).
